Hello, my name is Carl and I am a student who is currently studying T-Level Digital Production, Design and Development (Level 3) at Middlesbrough College. I have an interest in a number of areas of computing, particularly web design and development. The programming language that I am most experienced in at the moment is Python but I will be learning more as part of my course, in the second year.
