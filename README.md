Hello, my name is Carl and I am a student who is currently studying T-Level Digital Production, Design and Development (Level 3) at Middlesbrough College. I have an interest in a number of areas of computing, particularly web design and development. The programming language that I am most experienced in at the moment is Python, however I am learning C# and SQL for the occupational specialism that I have to complete for the second year of my course.
